# Garmin Filter

A project for allowing extended searching/filtering of Garmin Apps based on e.g. Permissions.

## Running the project

### Backend

You can run the backend locally by using the `docker-compose.yml` found in the `/backend` folder. 

It'll build the project and compose up a container listening at port 8080.

You can then access the API's swagger interface on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Frontend

You can run the frontend locally by executing `flutter run -d chrome` within the `/flutter-frontend` folder.

As you can probably tell from the name, this requires flutter to be installed on your PC.
