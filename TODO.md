# Todos

- Prettify Ordering (use dropdown instead of autocomplete like now, use descriptions instead of raw enum value)
- Prettify search interface (it's very clunky atm.)
- Support for filtering by developer (include AND exclude option)
- Support for all app-types (currently only shows watch faces)
- Option to mark apps as "ignore this", to avoid seeing them again
- caching of images server-side
- Option to filter for at minimum required number of reviews
